description: "Learn how to attach performance metrics to your transactions."
---

The Sentry SDK supports sending performance metrics data to Sentry. These are numeric values attached to transactions that are aggregated and displayed in Sentry.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/automatic-performance-metrics" />

In addition to automatic performance metrics, the SDK supports setting custom performance metrics on transactions. This allows you to define metrics that are important to your application and send them to Sentry.

To set a performance metric, supply a name (string), value (numeric - float, integer, etc.), and unit (string). Sentry supports adding arbitrary custom units, but we recommend using one of the [supported units listed below](./#supported-performance-metric-units).

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/custom-performance-metrics" />

## Supported Performance Metric Units

Units augment metric values by giving them a magnitude and semantics. Sentry leverages units associated with performance metrics to apply built-in unit conversions and controls in the product. For values that are unitless, you can supply an empty string or `none`.

### Duration Units

A time duration.

- `nanosecond`
- `microsecond`
- `millisecond`
- `second`
- `minute`
- `hour`
- `day`
- `week`

### Information Units

Size of information derived from bytes.

- `bit`
- `byte`
- `kilobyte`
- `kibibyte`
- `megabyte`
- `mebibyte`
- `gigabyte`
- `gibibyte`
- `terabyte`
- `tebibyte`
- `petabyte`
- `petabyte`
- `pebibyte`
- `exabyte`
- `exbibyte`

## Fraction Units

- `ratio`
- `percent`

For those looking to explore further, details about the supported list of units can be found in our [event ingestion documentation](https://getsentry.github.io/relay/relay_metrics/enum.MetricUnit.html).
